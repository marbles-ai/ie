  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Walter M. Shaub\u2019s term as the government\u2019s top ethics watchdog does not expire until next January, but his corner office here, just a few blocks from the White House, looks unoccupied.\nNo diplomas line the wood-paneled walls. No family photos or mementos. Just standard government-issue furniture, his humming computer and four large paintings. Mr. Shaub wanted to get rid of those, too, but his chief of staff warned that it might scare the 70 other employees in the Office of Government Ethics.\n\u201cI wanted to not be so attached to this office that I\u2019d be afraid to lose it,\u201d Mr. Shaub said on Friday, surveying the room he packed up shortly before Inauguration Day.\nFor a man and agency that have long labored in obscurity, that does not seem such a far-off possibility these days. Ethics have been thrust to the forefront in President Trump\u2019s Washington, where the president\u2019s own vast holdings and those of his asset-rich cabinet and advisers from businesses and lobbying firms have raised many accusations  of conflicts of interest.\nMr. Shaub, 46, has emerged as one of the few voices from within the government willing to second-guess the president and his advisers. At first quietly and then in a rare public speech here in January, Mr. Shaub tried to nudge Mr. Trump toward the only financial arrangement he felt was truly ethical \u2014 the total liquidation of his vast business and personal holdings.\nHe failed. But that confrontation and a string of others in the months since have given Mr. Shaub, a self-effacing career bureaucrat more comfortable parsing legal arguments and wonkish ethics guidelines, the reputation of a fighter. Admiring fans have put his face on T-shirts. He even has a Facebook fan group, with more than 1,000 likes.\n\u201cThe story of Walter Shaub is to some extent the story of our American system of checks and balances that has stepped up beyond expectation to defend the Constitution and the law when Trump oversteps,\u201d said Norman Eisen, the Obama administration\u2019s first ethics counsel. Mr. Shaub, he added, might well be \u201cthe unlikeliest star of 2017.\u201d\nRepublicans do not see it that way. The president\u2019s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, warned Mr. Shaub on national television to \u201cbe careful\u201d of criticizing the president. Outside groups have pointed to a handful of donations he made to Democratic campaigns in 2008 and 2012 as evidence of bias.\nFor Mr. Shaub, who has spent the better part of 15 years in the ethics office \u2014 mostly as a career civil servant \u2014 the experience has been as confounding as it is exhausting.\n\u201cIf you really look at things, all I\u2019ve done is stand still. It\u2019s the world that is moving around me,\u201d Mr. Shaub said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s seen as some radical act.\u201d\nIf he has become more outwardly vocal than directors past, he said, it is because this particular White House has shown little interest in an ethics program that both Republicans and Democrats have long supported. His public remarks, he added, came only after he felt the usual private channels of communication with the Trump team were not working.\n\u201cI\u2019m not fighting against him. I\u2019m fighting for the ethics program. And there is a difference,\u201d Mr. Shaub said. \u201cBecause if I succeed, he\u2019ll benefit.\u201d\nMr. Shaub has had some success. Though Mr. Trump ultimately put his assets into a so-called half-blind trust that Mr. Shaub has called ineffectual, the ethics office has worked closely and productively to steer the president\u2019s nominees through necessary financial disclosures and ethics agreements.\nMr. Trump\u2019s budget director, Mick Mulvaney, tried to block what Mr. Shaub and others said was a standard request for the names of former lobbyists who had been granted waivers to work in the Trump administration.\nOn Friday, after Mr. Shaub wrote a long and heavily footnoted letter to Mr. Mulvaney, the White House unexpectedly backed down.\nThe White House declined to comment on Mr. Shaub.\nThe Office of Government Ethics is not usually a breeding ground for political stardom \u2014 or conflict. Set up in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, its job is to work with a network of ethics offices in federal agencies to oversee ethical standards for 2.7 million civilian government employees. This means examining financial disclosure reports issued by political employees, to help these new hires decide which assets they must sell to avoid a conflict of interest. The office also helps ensure that once new political employees are hired, they honor restrictions from participating in deliberations over topics they handled for paying clients.\nThough the president is not strictly beholden to those laws, the ethics office has always relied on support from the top to send a message to the rest of the federal work force that its program needs to be taken seriously. The office, agency veterans say, has long prided itself on being nonpartisan, not least because its effective operation depends on strong relationships with whichever party is in the White House.\nThe son of a government chemist, Mr. Shaub grew up in the Washington suburbs with a sense that whatever he chose to do, it ought to entail public service. An interest in ethics only came later, after degrees in history at James Madison University and law at American University. (Two decades later, his own financial disclosure forms show, Mr. Shaub is still paying off student debt.)\nIn a city where the line between work and socializing often blurs, Mr. Shaub has mostly kept his worlds separate. His interests tend toward the geeky, friends say, like zombie stories and film noir. \u201cHe would enjoy puns, especially ones where people would just groan,\u201d said Don Fox, a longtime top agency official. Pop culture, with the possible exception of Harry Potter stories, less so.\n\u201cHe speaks loudly. He tells funny jokes. He rushes up and down the hall,\u201d said Marilyn Glynn, who hired Mr. Shaub in 2001 and helped recruit him back to the agency in 2006 after a brief stint in the private sector. \u201cYou can\u2019t miss him. It\u2019s like a little bit of a hurricane in the office.\u201d\nIt was in 2006 that Mr. Shaub first began formally working on ethics issues, overseeing the office\u2019s program guiding 1,100 or so presidential nominees through legally required financial disclosures. He turned the program around, writing standardized handbooks to speed up a typically ornery process and developed a reputation among Democrats and Republicans in the White House as a stern, but highly proficient, steward.\n\u201cI\u2019d call him up on a Thursday or Friday night and say we need to get this done over the weekend, and he would get the ethics lawyers and the agencies to stay and get it done,\u201d said Richard W. Painter, who served as ethics counsel for the George W. Bush White House. He has vocally defended Mr. Shaub\u2019s approach in recent months.\nWhen Mr. Obama nominated Mr. Shaub for the agency\u2019s top job and its only politically appointed post four years later, Congress approved him by voice vote, a rare sign of shared confidence from an otherwise sharply divided Congress. The first four years of his tenure have borne that out, colleagues say. Mr. Shaub has spent the bulk of his time pursuing prosaic bureaucratic reforms like file digitization and developing an online training program for the government\u2019s varied ethics officers.\n\u201cThis is not a guy who came from the outside and sees this as a great platform for becoming famous,\u201d said Danielle Brian, the executive director of the nonpartisan Project on Government Oversight. \u201cThis is a guy who has been working quietly for a long time on ethics issues.\u201d\nIn the ethics office\u2019s fifth-floor suite here, though, those days feel like a distant memory. Presidential transitions always bring a tsunami of work, but the spotlight trained on the agency this time around has only added stress. Employees have taken to meeting for 10 minutes a day to meditate in a dimly lit conference room.\nRick Thomas, a close friend who helped recruit Mr. Shaub to the agency almost two decades ago, said Mr. Shaub had more or less made his peace with his role, even if it means he may be fired before his term\u2019s end. He recalled that when Mr. Shaub was first weighing whether to speak out in opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s conflict of interest plan, the director turned to a line from Albus Dumbledore, the sagacious wizard who tutors Harry Potter in the ways of the world.\n\u201cSomething to the effect that, \u2018There will be a time when we must choose between what\u2019s easy and what\u2019s right,\u2019\u201d Mr. Thomas recalled Mr. Shaub saying over the phone.\n\u201cBelieve me,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was a lot of angst over that.\u201d",
