  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Hundreds of independent pharmacists swarmed the House and Senate office buildings one recent afternoon, climbing the marble staircases as they rushed from one appointment to the next, pitching lawmakers on their plan to rein in the soaring drug prices that have enraged American consumers.\nAs they crowded into lawmakers\u2019 offices, describing themselves as the industry\u2019s \u201cwhite hats,\u201d they pointed a finger at pharmacy benefit managers like Express Scripts and CVS Health, which handle the drug coverage of millions of Americans.\n\u201cWant to reduce prescription drug costs?\u201d the pharmacists argued during their visits. \u201cPay attention to the middlemen.\u201d\nA civil war has broken out among the most powerful players in the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 including brand-name and generic drug makers, and even your local pharmacists \u2014 with each blaming others for the rising price of medicine.\nIt is an industry that was already spending nearly double what other business sectors in the United States economy allocate on lobbying, and those sums continue to rise. President Trump has only heightened anxiety by accusing the drug industry of \u201cgetting away with murder,\u201d even though he has not weighed in with his own proposal.\nFor now, lawmakers are facing an almost daily assault.\n\u201cEveryone is very eager to maximize their profits and get a piece of the pie, and sorting it all out is complicated,\u201d said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.\nThe question is whether a rare confluence of public outrage, political will and presidential leadership can bring about a meaningful change that will slow the drain on consumers\u2019 pocketbooks.\n\u201cYou remember that old photograph of the Three Stooges, their faces cracked sideways and they are pointing at each other?\u201d asked Chester Davis Jr., the president of the Association for Accessible Medicines, sitting in the basement cafeteria of the Russell Senate Office Building at the start of a day in which he would make his own pitches on behalf of generic drugmakers. \u201cEveryone is doing the finger-pointing, when in fact there is a lot of blame to go around.\u201d\nIn polls, Democrats and Republicans alike have lowering drug prices near the top of their health care priorities. Public anger has risen along with the skyrocketing prices for many essential medicines \u2014 insulin for diabetes, for example, and EpiPens for severe allergic reactions. But will efforts to reduce drug costs surmount the industry\u2019s aggressive lobbying and campaign contributions?\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a very uphill fight,\u201d said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, who like Ms. Collins has been pushing Congress to increase competition and lower prices, \u201cgiven the millions they have spent on lobbying, advertising and campaign contributions.\u201d\nWith billions in profit on the line, the pharmaceutical and health products industry has already spent $78 million on lobbying in the first quarter of this year, a 14 percent jump over last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The industry pays some 1,100 lobbyists \u2014 more than two for each member of Congress.\nIn the 2016 election cycle, the industry poured more than $58 million into the election campaigns of members of Congress and presidential candidates, as well as other political causes, the Center for Responsive Politics data shows. That was the biggest investment in the industry\u2019s history and a 20 percent jump from the last presidential election cycle in 2012.\nNo single proposal has emerged as a clear winner in the bid to lower prices. Mr. Trump has sent conflicting signals: On one hand, he has accused the industry of \u201cprice fixing\u201d and has said the government should be allowed to negotiate the price of drugs covered by Medicare. At other times, he has talked about rolling back regulations and named an industry-friendly former congressman, Tom Price, to head the Department of Health and Human Services, and a former pharmaceutical consultant, Scott Gottlieb, to lead the Food and Drug Administration.\nMembers of Congress have put forward a grab-bag of options, each of which would help or hurt different industry players.\nSome address minor aspects, such as a bipartisan bill that would force brand-name drugmakers to hand over samples of their drugs to generic competitors. One would allow for the importing of cheaper drugs. Another would  force pharmacy benefit managers to disclose more information about how they did business.\nFor now, it is a free-for-all.\nThe brand-name drug industry is the dominant player. It spends the most on campaign contributions, has the largest army of lobbyists and has the biggest pile of chits among lawmakers to try to protect its own interests.\nIts trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, was so concerned about its vulnerability this year that it increased its annual dues by 50 percent \u2014 generating an extra $100 million to flood social media, television stations, as well as newspapers and magazines with advertising that reminds consumers of the industry\u2019s role in helping to save lives. A second set of PhRMA ads point blame for price increases elsewhere, like benefit managers and health insurers.\nIn doing so, PhRMA is seeking to rehabilitate a reputation that was damaged by the actions of companies like Turing Pharmaceuticals, which sharply hiked the price of a decades-old medicine. Its unapologetic former chief executive, Martin Shkreli, came to be seen as the ultimate illustration of the industry\u2019s bad deeds.\nThough Turing was never a member of the group, PhRMA recently purged nearly two dozen companies from its membership after it voted to exclude investor-driven drug companies like Turing.\nNearly every week that Congress is in session, the industry holds fund-raisers at private clubs and restaurants to help bankroll the re-election campaigns of its allies. One former lobbyist for PhRMA recently boasted that he had once organized six fund-raising events in a two-day period. (He asked that he not be named because the fund-raising efforts are supposed to be confidential.)\nIn late April, for example, a PhRMA Industry Breakfast was hosted for Representative John Shimkus, Republican of Illinois, at the National Republican Club of Capitol Hill, a members-only hot spot across the street from the Capitol.\nThe industry had reason to thank Mr. Shimkus. Last year, he helped save pharmaceutical companies billions of dollars by persuading the Obama administration to kill a project that was meant to test ways to lower the cost of the so-called Medicare Part B program, which spent $24.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2015.\nMr. Shimkus, who received nearly $300,000 in drug-industry contributions in the last election cycle, led an effort to collect signatures from 242 members of the House challenging the effort. He also co-sponsored legislation that threatened to block it, which became moot after the Obama administration backed down.\nA spokesman for Mr. Shimkus said his actions were intended to protect cancer patients \u2014 pointing to a clinic in his district he said might close if the Medicare program had gone into effect \u2014 not the pharmaceutical industry.\nBut other participants said industry influence \u2014 as drug companies attempted to preserve their bottom line \u2014 had played a decisive role.\n\u201cWhen we first proposed this, people were warning me, \u2018Be careful, everybody on K Street is going to be gunning for you now,\u2019 and I did not really know what they meant,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, a top Obama administration official who pushed the prescription drug price experiment. \u201cNow I know. When you take on pharma, you take on this whole town.\u201d\nStephen J. Ubl, the chief executive of PhRMA, acknowledged that his group had been \u201cvery engaged\u201d in defending his member companies\u2019 interests, and blamed a few bad actors \u2014 not his own members \u2014 for the public\u2019s disapproval.\n\u201cThe researchers wake up every day working for better treatments and cures,\u201d he said, echoing his organization\u2019s multimillion-dollar advertising campaign, \u201cGo Boldly.\u201d\nThe pharmacy benefit managers are giants themselves. Two of the biggest, Express Scripts and CVS Health, which are among the nation\u2019s 50 largest companies, have initiated their own counteroffensive.\nIn February, Mark Merritt, the president of the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, the trade group for benefit managers, outlined a strategy to \u201cengage the new administration\u201d and to build \u201ca political firewall on Capitol Hill,\u201d according to a confidential memo that was first made public by BuzzFeed.\nThe memo bragged about the group\u2019s courting of senior Trump administration officials. It also said it had met with Capitol Hill staff members and lawmakers, formed a partnership with conservative advocacy groups and created an advertising campaign called \u201cDrug Benefit Solutions.\u201d\nLast month, the group hosted several hundred government officials and other industry players at a fancy \u201cpolicy forum\u201d a few blocks from the Capitol, where it detailed just why its members were \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to save consumers money.\nA smaller war is playing out between pharmacy benefit managers and pharmacists, confrontations that have included covert operations.\nWhen the independent pharmacists descended on Capitol Hill in late April, they came with a brochure depicting benefit managers as sharp-toothed dogs, grabbing bags of money.\nYet even as they walked the halls, a group calling itself Ask Your Independent Pharmacist sent a blast email to some of the same lawmakers the pharmacists had just met with. \u201cWhose interests are they on the Hill to champion \u2014 the pharmacist\u2019s pocketbook or the patients they claim to serve?\u201d an email asked.\nWhen The New York Times called a public relations firm, Kivvit, which operates out of an address listed on the email, staff members repeatedly hung up when asked who had paid for the message. After a reporter called the firm\u2019s Chicago headquarters, Tracy Schmaler, a Justice Department aide in the Obama administration who now works at Kivvit, responded: Express Scripts had paid for the message.\nJonah Houts, the head of government affairs at Express Scripts, said the company\u2019s role as a middleman drew fire from all sides.\n\u201cWe were designed to create tension,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re successful at what we do, and that\u2019s why we want to make sure the lawmakers who are considering legislation that affects us understand that.\u201d\nThe generics industry has also come under attack. Though its drugs are generally cheap, some have also risen sharply in price, and prosecutors have been investigating claims of price-fixing by some of the largest players, including Mylan.\nHeather Bresch, the chief executive of Mylan and a former chairwoman of the generics trade group, has been pilloried on social media for her role in hiking the price of EpiPens, even though EpiPens sold as branded drugs, not generics.\nAs the controversy over EpiPens unfolded, Ms. Bresch shifted criticism toward what she called the \u201cbroken system\u201d of brokers, distributors and pharmacists who take a cut of the price, too. In January, the generics trade group shed its old name for one that reflects the changed political climate: the Association for Accessible Medicines.\nMr. Doggett, the Texas Democrat, said the industry war was in some ways a positive sign.\n\u201cWe have moved from \u2018There is no problem\u2019 to \u2018It\u2019s not my fault,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt begins to focus attention on what so many of my constituents already know the problem is, which is price gouging.\u201d",
