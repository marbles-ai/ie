        <h1>Fake News!</h1>
        <p class="lead">Fake news is having a significant impact on our society! It not only allows bad actors to influence
            other countries' elections, but it is also making it difficult for citizens to understand what is going on
            around them and make their politicians accountable for their actions.

          <h2>The Election</h2>
          <p>Russia had a hand in swaying the American elections in 2016. By pumping social media with fake
          news that was quickly shared, voters were swayed by false information.</p>

          <h2>Manchester Attack</h2>
          <p>After the Manchester suicide attack on the 22nd of May, 2017, there was a flood of fake
          reports about missing people. This information was then rapidly proliferated as soon as it was
          introduced.

          <p>The political left has become as targeted by fake news as the right, with false information about

    <p>
        We solve the problem of identifying Fake News by using a combination of state of the art Natural Language Processing and
        Machine Learning techniques to analyze information as it comes in. We gather information using our large selection of
        RSS feeds from websites, Twitter, Facebook, etc. This information is transformed from its raw form into a machine-readable
        semantic discourse representation that we call Marbles. These Marbles represent the semantics and knowledge represented
        in the information gathered.
    </p>

    <p>
        We then use both supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning techniques to determine the source of information, which we
        call "Golden Marbles", and both similarities and differences between different sources' Marbles. This allows us to find
        outlier Marbles that deviate from Golden Marbles. Our technique allows for a much deeper understanding of the information,
        and it also allows us to evaluate the factualness of information without considering the source. This is particularly
        important, because of the growing disagreement between members of differing political parties with relation to the
        factualness of different information sources.
