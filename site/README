This is our Dockerized website.
To run on your machine, run:
	docker build -t website .		# This creates a Docker Image, which is tagged with the 'website' name
						# Run 'docker images' to make sure that the image shows up under 'website'
	docker run -p 5000:5000 website		# This runs the app, mapping the localhost port 5000 to the exposed port 5000
						# You should now be able to view the website from http://localhost:5000
