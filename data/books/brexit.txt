The managing director of the International Monetary Fund has said she wants Britain to stay in the EU, warning that a looming Brexit referendum posed a risk to the UK economy. In an upbeat assessment, Christine Lagarde said the UK was enjoying strong growth, record employment and had largely recovered from the global financial crisis. Presenting the IMF’s annual healthcheck of the economy alongside George Osborne, Lagarde said there were risks to the outlook, including from the housing market, but she was generally positive. “The UK authorities have managed to repair the damage of the crisis in a way few other countries have been able to do,” she said. Lagarde said the IMF would work through various scenarios for the EU referendum outcome in its next assessment of the UK in May 2016. “On a personal basis … I am very, very much hopeful that the UK stays within the EU,” she added. Separately, ratings agency Standard & Poor’s reiterated a warning on Friday that leaving the EU could cost the UK its top credit score. The IMF, which is based in Washington, also used its assessment to recommend that interest rates remain at their record low of 0.5% until there were clearer signs of inflationary pressures. Its report on the UK was delayed for six months due to the general election.
