These instructions will help you build and run the docker container for our Marbles back-end
 
To run on your machine, run:
	docker build -t docker .		# This creates a Docker Image, which is tagged with the 'docker' name
						# Run 'docker images' to make sure that the image shows up under 'website'
	docker run -p 5000:5000 website		# This runs the app, mapping the localhost port 5000 to the exposed port 5000
						# Add -d for detached mode
